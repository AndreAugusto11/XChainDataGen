class Extractor(ABC):
    """
    Extractor is a class responsible for orchestrating the extraction of blockchain logs and
    transactions for a specified bridge and blockchain. It manages the division of block ranges,
    multi-threaded processing, dynamic handler loading, and the decoding and handling of logs
    and transactions.

    Attributes:
        CLASS_NAME (str): The name of the class.
        task_queue (Queue): Queue to manage block range tasks for worker threads.
        threads (list): List of active worker threads.
        blockchain (str): The blockchain network to extract data from.
        bridge (Bridge): The bridge instance specifying the protocol/bridge.
        rpc_client (RPCClient): Client for interacting with blockchain RPC endpoints.
        decoder (BridgeDecoder): Decoder for parsing logs specific to the bridge.
        handler (BaseHandler): Handler for processing and storing extracted data.

    Methods:
        __init__(self, bridge: Bridge, blockchain: str):
            Initializes the Extractor with the specified bridge and blockchain, sets up the RPC
            client, decoder, and handler.

        load_handler(self) -> BaseHandler:
            Dynamically loads and returns the handler for the specified bridge.

        divide_range(start_block: int, end_block: int, chunk_size: int = 1000):
            Divides a block range into smaller chunks for parallel processing.

        work(self, contract: str, topics: list, start_block: int, end_block: int):
            Processes logs and transactions for a given contract and block range, decodes logs, and
            invokes the bridge handler.

        worker(self):
            Worker function for threads to process block ranges from the task queue.

        extract_data(self, start_block: int, end_block: int, blockchains: list):
            Main extraction logic that validates contracts, divides block ranges, launches worker
            threads, and coordinates the extraction process.
